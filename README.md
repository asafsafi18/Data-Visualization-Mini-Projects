Scenario & task for this project:
Due to recent unfortunate airline crashes, the media has been promoting statistics stating air travel is no longer a safe way to travel. But are any of these claims based on facts?
I work for an airline on the data science team, as a data analyst and am a resident data visualization expert. I have been tasked with helping multiple groups in the organization to combat this negative
publicity and help tell the airlineâ€™s side of the story. In this assignment, I am charged with what is published to the public and the media.
